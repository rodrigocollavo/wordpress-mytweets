Fetches and displays tweets from twitter.com with the Twitter API.

== Description ==
It enables to display tweets anywhere you want such as in the sidebar, posts, and pages. It does not rely on JavaScript so the tweets will be displayed for visitors disabling JavaScript in their browsers. Not only can you show your own tweets but also the mashed up results of multiple user's timelines.

It is easy to set up for WordPress beginners. It does not require you to provide authentication keys. 

Media files are automatically displayed such as YouTube videos and photos posted in tweets. You can disable them with the setting. 

It allows developers to write additional add-ons and templates. One of the extensions, [Feeder](http://en.michaeluno.jp/fetch-tweets/extensions/feeder/), supports feeds so you can subscribe your favorite person’s tweets as RSS, which has become harder as the Twitter API was upgraded and the previous version no longer support tweet feed without authentication keys. With this addon, if you are a programmer, you can import the tweet data as JSON to your application by making the WordPress as own Twitter API server.

If you are a theme developer, you can easily customize the template for the tweet outputs. Just copy the existing template and modify the copied files and rename the template name. Then place the copied folder into the theme folder. And there you go! Your own template will be listed in the plugin’s setting page. This way, when the plugin updates, you won’t loose your modifications.

<h4>Features</h4>
* **Fetching Timeline** - by specifying the user name, the timeline can be fetched and displayed as well as your account's home timeline.
* **Search Results** - by specifying the search keyword, the results can be fetched and displayed.
* **Lists**	- tweet timeline for members of the specified list can be fetched and displayed.
* **Custom API Query** - if you are a developer and familiar with Twitter API, you can directly specify the query url to send to Twitter.
* **Tweet ID** - you can fetch tweets by Tweet ID.
* **Mashups** - you can display the combined results from multiple rule sets of your choosing.
* **Widget** - tweets can be displayed in the widgets that the plugin provides.
* **Shortcode** - with the shortcode, the fetched tweets can be displayed in posts and pages.
* **PHP Code** - with the PHP function, the fetched tweets can be embedded in the templates.
* **Custom Templates** - you can change the design by modifying/creating the template file.
* **Background Cache Renewal** - it renews the caches in the background so it will prevent the page load from suddenly getting stuck for fetching external sources.
* **Embedded Media** - urls of media elements can be automatically converted to embedded elements.
 
== Installation ==

= Install = 

1. Upload **`fetch-tweets.php`** and other files compressed in the zip folder to the **`/wp-content/plugins/`** directory.,
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= How to Use = 
1. Authenticate the plugin via **Dashboard** -> **Fetch Tweets** -> **Settings** ( -> **Authentication** ( the default tab ) ) -> the **Connect** button.
2. Set a rule via **Dashboard** -> **Fetch Tweets** -> **Add Rule by USer Name** / **Add Rule by Keyword Search**.
3. To use it as a widget, go to **Appearance** -> **Widgets** and add **Fetch Tweets by Rule Set** to the desired sidebar. And select the rule in the widget form.
4. To use the shortcode to display tweets in posts and pages, simply enter the shortcode like below in the post,

== Other Notes ==

= Shortcode and Function Parameters =
The following parameters can be used for the shortcode or the PHP function of the plugin, <code>fetchTweets()</code>

* **id** - the ID(s) of the rule set. This cannot be used with the `tag`, `q`, or `screen_name` parameter. e.g.

`[fetch_tweets id="123"]`

`<?php fetchTweets( array( 'id' => 123 ) ); ?>`

In order to set multiple IDs, pass them with commas as the delimiter. e.g.

`[fetch_tweets id="123, 234, 345"]`

`<?php fetchTweets( array( 'id' => 123, 234, 345 ) ); ?>`

* **tag** - the tag(s) associated with the rule sets. This cannot be used with the `id`, `q`, or `screen_name` parameter. e.g.

`[fetch_tweets tag="WordPress"]`

`<?php fetchTweets( array( 'tag' => 'WordPress' ) ); ?>`

In order to set multiple tags, pass them with commas as the delimiter. e.g.

`[fetch_tweets tag="WordPress, developer"]`

`<?php fetchTweets( array( 'tag' => 'WordPress, developer' ) ); ?>`

* **operator** - the database query operator that is performed with the *tag* parameters. Either **AND**, **NOT IN**, or **IN** can be used. If this parameter is not set, AND will be used as the default value. For more information about this operator, refer to the [Taxonomy Parameter](http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Taxonomy_Parameters) section of Codex. e.g.

`[fetch_tweets tag="WordPress, PHP, JavaScript" operator="IN" ]`

`<?php fetchTweets( array( 'tag' => 'WordPress, PHP, JavaScript', 'operator' => 'IN' ) ); ?>`

`[fetch_tweets tag="developer" operator="NOT IN" ]`

`<?php fetchTweets( array( 'tag' => 'developer', 'operator' => 'NOT IN' ) ); ?>`

* **q** - the search keyword. This cannot be used with the `id`, `tag`, or `screen_name` parameter. e.g.

`[fetch_tweets q="#wordpress" lang="en"]`

`<?php fetchTweets( array( 'q' => '#wordpress', 'lang' => 'en' ) ); ?>`

* **screen_name** - the screen name(s). To pass multiple screen names, pass them separated by commas. This cannot be used with the `id`, `tag`, or `q` parameter. e.g.

`[fetch_tweets screen_name="WordPress,photomatt"]`

`<?php fetchTweets( array( 'screen_name' => 'WordPress,photomatt' ) ); ?>`

* **count** - the maximum number of tweets to display. e.g.

`[fetch_tweets id="456, 567" count="10" ]`

`<?php fetchTweets( array( 'id' => 456, 567, 'count' => 10 ) ); ?>`

* **avatar_size** - the size( max-width ) of the profile image in pixel. e.g.

`[fetch_tweets id="678" count="8" avatar_size="96" ]`

`<?php fetchTweets( array( 'id' => 678, 'count' => 8, 'avatar_size' => 96 ) ); ?>`

* **twitter_media** - true (1) / false (0). Determines whether the twitter media elements should be displayed.
* **external_media** - true (1)/ false (0). Determines whether the external media links should be replaced with embedded elements.

`[fetch_tweets id="678" twitter_media="0" external_media="1" ]`

`<?php fetchTweets( array( 'id' => 678, twitter_media="0" external_media="1" ) ); ?>`

= How to Create Own Template =

**Step 1**

Copy the folder named ***plain*** or ***single*** in the plugin's template folder. Rename the copied folder to something you like.

**Step 2**

Edit the following files.

* **style.css** - defines the template's CSS rules. Also some of the information in the header comment sections will appear in the template listing table.
* **template.php** - defines the layout of the tweets. PHP coding skill is required.
* **functions.php** ( optional ) - loaded if the template is activated when the plugin starts. If you don't edit this file, do not include it. Be careful not to declare any PHP function or class that is already declared in the original file.
* **settings.php** ( optional ) - loaded only in the admin area if the template is activated. If you don't edit this file, do not include it. Be careful not to declare any PHP function or class that is already declared in the original file.

In the *style.css* file, include the comment area ( with /* */ ) at the top of the file with the following entries.

* **Template Name:** - the template name.
* **Author:** - your name.
* **Author URI:** - your web site url.
* **Description:** - a brief description about the template.
* **Version:** - the version number of the template.

e.g.

`/*
	Template Name: Sample
	Author: Michael Uno
	Author URI: http://en.michaeluno.jp
	Description: A very simple sample template added as a WordPress plugin.
	Version: 1.0.0
*/`

**Step 3** ( optional )

Include a thumbnail image. Prepare an image with the name screenshot.jpg, screenshot.png, or screenshot.gif, and place the image in the working(copied in step 1) folder.

**Step 4**

Create a folder named **fetch-tweets** in the theme folder. If you use, for instance, Twenty Twelve, the location would be `.../wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/fetch-tweets/`.

Place the working folder( the copied and renamed one in step 1 ) in there. The plugin will automatically detect it and the template will be listed in the Template page of the admin page.

Optionally, a template can be added via a plugin. If you do so, add the template directory with the <code>fetch_tweets_filter_template_directories</code> filter hook.

e.g.
`add_filter( 'fetch_tweets_filter_template_directories', 'FetchTweets_AddSampleTemplateDirPath' );
function FetchTweets_AddSampleTemplateDirPath( $arrDirPaths ) {
	
	// Add the template directory to the passed array.
	$arrDirPaths[] = dirname( __FILE__ ) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'sample';
	return $arrDirPaths;
	
}`

You can check an example template [here](https://github.com/michaeluno/fetch-tweets-sample-template).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need API keys to use the plugin ? =
They are not necessary as of v1.3.0. Just click on the *Connect* button in the Authentication page of the plugin and it will redirect you to the Twitter's authentication page. Then you log in to Twitter there and authorize the plugin.

Though you can use your own keys with the existing method. In that case, click on the *Set Keys Manually* button that redirects you to the page to set the keys manually.

If you set authentication keys manually, you need to create an application to access the Twitter API [here](https://dev.twitter.com/apps). Then create *consumer key*, *consumer secret*, *access token*, and *access token secret*. Without these, you won't be able to fetch tweets.

= How can I create my own template file? =
See the How to Create Own Template section of the **[Other Notes](http://wordpress.org/plugins/fetch-tweets/other_notes/)** page.

= How do I display tweets with a certain hashtag from a specific user? =

* Go to Dashboard -> Fetch Tweets -> Add Rule by Search.
* Type `#HASHTAG AND from:SCREENNAME` in the Search Keyword meta box option field. Change the part, `#HASHTAG`, to your searching hash tag and the part, `SCREENNAME`, to the account's screen name to fetch tweets from.
* Create a rule by pressing the Publish button.

= Why don't tweets update? =

It could be that your host disables WP Cron. In that case, try the intense caching mode which can be configured via `Dashboard` -> `Fetch Tweets` -> `Settings` -> `General` -> `Cache Settings` -> `Caching Mode`.
