Expermiental Wordpress Site
---------------------------

This site is using the plugin 'Fetch Tweets' and the theme
'Pinpress'. The idea is to setup your personal tweet account
and show all the content in a main page with a pinterest
simil look.

It's working actually after I made some changes on the plugin 
but I need to improve the theme mainly.

This is a basic test, my idea is to add social functionality
and take control of the tweets that we want to show or
separate them in pages or sections.

Configuration
-------------

This site should work fine as it is. Probably you need to
reinstall 'fetch tweets' plugin to create DB tables.
